# personal-sentiment-analysis
Data Science project that implements sentiment analysis on your personal facebook account. By cross-examining the public timeline posts vs. the private messages, I created visualizations to discover if my private sentiment is different than my public sentiment. Then, I used a machine learning algorithm to predict what my future sentiment might be.
