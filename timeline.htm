Well hi there. I&#039;ve have absolutely missed you so much. SO. MUCH. I can&#039;t believe we&#039;ve been apart so long. How have I survived so far? Anyway, I decided to look at our friendship on Facebook to reminisce in our old times (and weird shenanigans) and I saw that on Facebook we&#039;re family. And honestly I can&#039;t think of a better way to describe us. I know it&#039;s been a bit but I also know that the next time I see you, or talk to you we&#039;re going to pick up right where we left off. I think you are indescribably wonderful and hope you had an amazing day among an incredible year. It&#039;s fun to think of all the things we did together: Boston! My house (pink barf), your house (killer bunnies), The City Bus, too many school things to count, marching band, band, and so, so, so much more. We&#039;ve been there for each other through many boys, many friends, and many happy/sad times. I love you girly and wish you the Happiest of Birthdays. 

&lt;3 &lt;3 Kayla

P.S. I thought this pic really represented our friendship ;)

I have known you guys since you were little freshman and we barely talked to each other our first year on the water polo team. It&#039;s crazy to think how much has happened in just four quick years. I honestly don&#039;t think I would be anywhere near the person I am today without you guys in my life. Whether we are playing water polo, or slack lining, or having a party, or lying down on our shoulders and knees on the floor to make our stomachs feel better after we&#039;ve eaten a big meal, I&#039;m never prepared for how much fun we all have together. I know everyone is on to bigger and better things next year, but just know that you&#039;re geeky little freshman friend is back here in Park City - missing you all like crazy. I can&#039;t wait to see where you guys go throughout the next few years, and though I&#039;m sure it will have some crazy turns - I hope we will still all be able to stay connected. I love you guys so much and I&#039;ll never forget our amazing memories! Congratulations on your Graduation!!! (And I better be able to see you ALL next year for mine) :) :) :) :)</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, June 5, 2013 at 6:36pm PDT</div>Jessie Smith with Morgan Keller and Kayla Guillory.<div class="comment">Accomplishment of the day: During third period going into the basketball court and after about six attempts, making a half court shot!!!

1) End of the World (and I feel Fine): For obvious reasons
2) Gimme Shelter - rolling stones: For all of the crazy people in New York building shelters right now.
3) I&#039;ll stop the World and Melt With you: Yes, it is from sky high... but I thought it might ease some tension in the middle of the &quot;crisis.&quot;
4) Eye of the Tiger: For some motivation when you have to beat up those zombies or stop the moon from disappearing or whatever.
5) We only got 4 minutes to save the world: Another inspirational song, for when you only got 4 minutes to save the world...?
6) Final Countdown: Kind of an epic way to say your gonna die soon.
7) What a wonderful world: A nice relief from all of the &quot;chaos&quot; happening in the world around you
8) I will survive: You keep telling yourself that... ;)
And there we go. My &quot;lets survive 2012 to go&quot; Playlist. I hope you enjoy! (And live too)</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, December 12, 2012 at 8:48pm PST</div><div class="comment">12/12/12</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, December 9, 2012 at 12:52pm PST</div>You and AJ Carpenter are now friends!

It&#039;s your birthday today. And that&#039;s really great because now you&#039;re a year older, and you can do all that cool stuff that you couldn&#039;t before. Like become a spy for the government, or go to an r-rated movie in a theater, go scuba diving, or make a flower of the month calendar. Any ways, I hope that you will choose to enjoy your last few years of freedom from the terrible world out there where you make your own choices and do whatever you want. Happy birthday Jessie!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 13, 2012 at 11:09am PDT</div><div class="comment">happy birthday jessie! hope everything&#039;s great :)</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 13, 2012 at 10:56am PDT</div><div class="comment">Once upon a time, there was a girl named jessie. Her (slightly) ginger hair and perfect face were the most beautiful anyone had ever seen. But Jessie has a problem. she was far too good for the fairy tale land she lived in. All the other girls were simply too jealous of her perfection. So Jessie decided to go out into the world and find where she could truly belong. Fist she traveled far, far away into a strange and new world called &quot;psych.&quot; Here jessie met a stranger named  Morgan who told her the wonder of pineapples and obscure references. And thus jessie and morgan decided to continue their journey. Next they traveled to a distant place called &quot;Water Polo Town&quot; where people loved to play and work out all day! It was odd, but jessie decided she LOVED it. So she and morgan stayed for a while, and in no time they met a new friend called Paige. The three became best friends and decided it was time to look for their own town. In this search they met a girl named Tori, and Tori showed them how to get others to join their town! But soon, the four decided to move on and in the next town, called &quot;Academically obsessed,&quot; they met another friend. Her name was Kayla and soon she loved Jessie the most of them all. And so the best friendship ever was formed. Though Jessie never could find anyone more beautiful than her! And they lived happily ever after. 
Love, 
Kayla</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 13, 2012 at 10:46am PDT</div><div class="comment">jessie!! happy birthday! hope you have a great day!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 13, 2012 at 10:43am PDT</div><div class="comment">happy birthday Jessie  </div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 13, 2012 at 9:51am PDT</div><div class="comment">Happy Birthday!!!!!!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 13, 2012 at 9:41am PDT</div><div class="comment">HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!

This will happen some day and u will regret ever not answering your phone!
